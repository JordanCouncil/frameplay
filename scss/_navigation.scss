/*----------------------------------------------------
        Sources, Inspirations, & Techniques
I learned so much by reading and studying code, and  
I would not have been able to develop Frameplay without 
the work of previous students, namely WELD, Robin, and 
MOPF - and the lectures, of course. Their examples, codes,
and designs helped me to find my own way forward. I will
do my best to highlight their influences more precisely 
throughout my code, but know that their influence, and that
of Jen Kramer's, is nothing short of universal since
                    I'M A NEWBIE.

// appears to enable column stack of nav bar at mobile size - no need for @media?
